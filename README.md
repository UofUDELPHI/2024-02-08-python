# 2024-02-08 Introduction to Python for Data Analysis workshop

The workshop website can be 
found here: https://uofudelphi.github.io/2024-02-08-python/

If you created a new repository, you need to set Settings > Pages > Branch settings to 'main' and '/docs/' to trigger a deployment when modifications are made on the main branch.

To make changes to the website, you can then make changes in the **main branch**, render your changes in your local version, and then push the changes to GitHub. The website should automatically update within a few minutes. 

For help publishing using GitHub pages with Quarto see: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html

### Content Notebooks

The content notebooks in this repo have been uploaded to Google Colab, and the links provided on the webpage are "Viewer" only links. Learners will need to make a copy of the notebook to work in it. Also ensure that they have the data files when relevant. 

To make changes to the notebook files, you will need to explicitly modify the version on Google Colab (modifications to the notebook files that live in this repo will *not* be reflected in the Colab version).
