# 2024-02-08 Introduction to Python for Data Analysis workshop

The workshop website can be

If you created a new repository, you need to set Settings > Pages > Branch settings to 'main' and '/docs/' in order to trigger a deployment when modifications are made on the main branch.

To make changes to the website, you can then make changes in the **main branch**, push 
them to GitHub, and they should automatically be updated online.
